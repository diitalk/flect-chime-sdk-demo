# Installation
## Prerequisite
It is assumed that AWS Credential is configured. If you have not yet done so, please refer to this page to configure it.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html

## Build backend
### (1) define stack name
Define the stack name for backend.
```
$ emacs backend/bin/config.ts

export const BACKEND_STACK_NAME = 'BackendStack' # <-- You should change. (*1)
export const FRONTEND_LOCAL_DEV = false          # <-- Set false for deployment.
```
(*1) This demo uses S3 bucket whose name is defined with this value. So, this value should be global unique.

### (2) build and deploy backend

```
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm run build_all
```

## Build frontend
Note: frontend and fontend2 are depricated. Please use frontend3

### (1) build
when you run `npm run build`, you get the information of backend

```
$ cd frontend2
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

### (2) deploy frontend
```
$ sh sync.sh
```

### (3) access to the demo
You can find URL of demo in `demo_url.txt`. Please access this URL with browser.


# Delete Stack
```
$ cdk destroy
```


# Warning!!
In this demo, google meet model for virtual background is used. At the time I started develop, the license of the model is APACHE-2.0. But currently the license is changed and not APACHE-2.0 any more. I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know much about it, but I generally believe that license changes do not apply retroactively to previous deliverables. However, you should obtain and(or) use the model at your own risk.
